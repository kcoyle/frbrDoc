				<h2>The Work Question</h2>
		<p>As librarians became increasingly aware of the concept of the work and the potential importance it has for library users, various members of the profession put forth their ideas on how to define this abstract concept. The best source of information on this aspect of librarianship is Smiraglia's book, <em>The Nature of 'a work': Implications for the organization of knowledge.</em> As Smiraglia concludes elsewhere,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;A catalog inventory of books must give way to an encyclopedic catalog of works. In this there is no dissent.&quot; [smiraglia 2012 p. 361]</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>I suspect that some dissent could always be found within the cataloging community, but it is the case that the question of the work had planted itself fully within the cataloging theory of the mid to late 20th century, with Lubetzky and Wilson as the most influential theorists of that view. </p>


				<h2>Lubetzky&#039;s Work View</h2>
  <p>Seymour Lubetzky's analysis of the principles of cataloging, published in 1969, became the groundwork for all cataloging rules that have followed. This work greatly influenced the revision of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules in 1978. Writing in the time of the card catalog, Lubetzky's principles are designed to collocate works through the use of a &quot;main entry&quot; which consists of the author and the title, or, in the case of editions of a work, the uniform title. Lubetzky's view emphasized authorship over the content of the item being cataloged, which was welcomed by catalogers who work in areas where they frequently encounter reproductions. [yee, part4] Although Lubetzky is considered to have brought the &quot;work question&quot; to the attention of the library cataloging community, he himself subordinated the work to the author. He also did not provide a definition of work, other than to say that the work of an author is the &quot;product of his mind or skill.&quot; [quoted in Yee4 p14]</p>
  <h2>Wilson&#039;s Bibliographic Families</h2>
		Patrick Wilson's "Two Kinds of Power" (1968) is a book that is often mentioned but whose message does not seem to have disseminated through library and cataloging thinking. If it had, we might not have had AACR2, FRBR or RDA, because he distinguishes between the description of books (which is the role of cataloging) and the appraisal of books (exploitative control) which is "...the ability to make the best use of a body of writings..." [Wilson, p. 25] This latter is, in Wilson's view, the superior capability, which means that he sees bibliographic description as necessary but inferior.

Although not a focus of the book, he defines a work not as an aspect of a single text, but "... a work simply is a group of family of texts..." Families develop over time as texts are reproduced or republished in the same or modified form:'
<blockquote>"The production of a work is clearly not the writing down of all the members of the family, but is rather the starting of a family, the composing of one or more texts that are the ancestors of later members of the family." [p.9]</blockquote>
Wilson addresses the separation of a work from the text that expresses the work. He states that the work and the text are not the same thing because there can be variations in the text that do not create a new work. He also considers translations members of the work family. He does not, however, consider the work and the text as separate entities:
<blockquote>"These three descriptions [a work, the words, and the inscription of the words] are not independent, for he could have produced no work without producing some text, and could have produced no text without producing some permanent or transitory exemplar of the text." [p. 6]</blockquote>
Wilson does not create a diagrammatic view of his family, but Smiraglia presents one in his book.

In this case, the "progenitor" is a hardback published in 1969, with close kin of a paperback in the same year from the same publisher in New York, a Canadian version published in Toronto, and a version published in London. Reprintings of the New York and Toronto versions become children of their respective progenitors. Translations follow, each with the original as "parent" and potentially with children of their own if there are re-publications of those.  

Wilson's view is a possible interpretation of S. R. Ranganathan's statement that "A library is a growing organism." In Wilson's view, the library grows not only in the number of volumes but with the addition of volumes families grow in a variety of ways. Each addition to the library potentially adds to the familial relationships that are there, and thus each may alter the nature of the bibliographic family that exists.

Notably, Wilson leaves the concept of the work as without sharp boundaries, which is later justified in his description of the exploitative power, which is individual and contextual and therefore cannot be defined with absolute precision.
<blockquote>"While there is good reason to distinguish work from text, it is necessary to recognize that the notion of a work is an incorrigibly vague one." p. 11</blockquote>
It appears that Wilson did not exclude the idea of a family including adapted works, such as films derived from books.

It is quite possible that, aside from philosophers, few people make reference to true abstractions. Even those social constructs such as "love" and "loyalty" may stand for actual experiences in the person's life. Broad categorizations in speech and thought are inclusive of all that the category implies -- for that person in that social context. Looked at from this view, the FRBR Work would need to represent the entire family [Wilson] implied by the Work, and the breadth of that family would depend on the user's context. Since library cataloging cannot address the individual user, we could posit that there are at least some discernible categories of users ("casual readers" "college students" "experts") that need to be addressed.
<h2>Smiraglia&#039;s Semiotic View</h2>
		<p>Richard Smiraglia has written perhaps the only book on &quot;the work question.&quot; In it he covers the various definitions that have arisen in librarianship, but also adds his own, based on 20th century semiotics. His definition of the work follows on from that of Lubetzky and  Wilson:
 <blockquote>
   <p>&quot;We concluded that 'work' is an abstract concept, although works have very real instantiations as physical objects. We concluded that a work is a new synthesis--unique at the point of its creation--that consists of both ideas (ideational content) and symbols for their expression (semantic content).&quot; p. 53</p>
 </blockquote>
<p>By taking a semiotic view, Smiraglia includes the reader in his view of the work, and affords the work itself with a cultural and communicative role that changes with each reading (or viewing, or listening). Because his view includes communication and culture his theory can take into account some of the particular characteristics of different kinds of works, such as music which has the added facet of performance. 
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Thus we replace the arbitrariness of the abstract concept of the work with a definitive changeling. Works change over time, they take on new meanings as they are assimilated in cultures, they reflect their perceptions, and they evolve in content and tangibility.&quot; p. 72</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the other theorists in this summary, Smiraglia conducted quantitative research to discover the extent of work relations in libraries. He sampled the OCLC WorldCat database, New York University's Bobst library, the Georgetown University library, and the Burke Theological Library. (Note that these studies were done in 1992 and 1999. Since then the nature of WorldCat has changed considerably due to the addition of many millions of bibliographic records from non-member, and primarily non-US, libraries.) After an analysis of the bibliographic families in his carefully selected samples, he concludes that the &quot;only strong predictor of derivation was the age of the progenitor work.&quot; [p.89] In other words, families develop over time. They also tend to develop more for some genres, like fiction and drama, than for scientific works. 
<p>Both Wilson and Smiraglia emphasize that what begins as a new work can give birth to a large family of works through a variety of changes such as revisions, augmentations, performances, adaptations. Where one draws the line and declares that a new work has been created is not clear, and perhaps should not be. 

				<h2>Coyle&#039;s Cognitive View</h2>
		 <p>Cognitive science has studied numerous models of conceptual thinking as part of the human understanding of the world. Concepts have an element of generality/specificity whose exact function in understanding and communication is not yet clear. Regardless of our inability to define how thinking works, every moment provides proof that we do share enough of our conceptual matter to function together in the world. All of this has a strong  social component. One of those commonalities is something referred to as the <em>basic level of categorization,</em> which means that within a social group we have understood common levels of specificity for things and concepts. [Murphy, p. 211] A simple illustration is this: </p>
    <p>Jane and John are walking down the street when they see their neighbor's calico cat. John says: &quot;Hey, there's Fred's cat.&quot; Later, at the zoo, Jane says to John: &quot;Take a look at that tiger.&quot; Both are felines, yet the words &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;tiger&quot; demonstrate different levels of categorization within our culture, probably based on how common these things are in our shared experience. Each is an understood shorthand for what is obviously a much more complex concept. There is no need to say: &quot;Look, there's a vertebrate mammal of the feline species, sub-species house cat, variety calico, that belongs to Fred,&quot; even though that is indeed the case. Instead, &quot;cat&quot; is the level of categorization that allows us to efficiently express a concept that others in our environment will most likely understand. When you type &quot;cat&quot; into the English language Wikipedia, the article that is retrieved represents this same concept of cat as &quot;house cat,&quot; while &quot;tiger&quot; gets its own page. This reflects a shared level of categorization in the English-speaking (Wikipedia-editing) world.</p>
    <p>The basic level of categorization is not an absolute, however, but depends on a social context. Experts in a field will have a different basic level than the general public (&quot;sparrow&quot; &quot;<em>Passer domesticus</em>&quot;) and aficionados amongst themselves will make distinctions that a less interested person will not (&quot;car&quot; &quot;Mercedes&quot; &quot;Mercedes-Benz C 215 v6&quot;). Analogously, librarians will have a shared professional understanding that is at a more detailed level of categorization than members of the general public. Lubetzky and others frequently state that a library patron may state that he is looking for a book, when in fact he is interested primarily in the work rather than a specific physical item. The question, though, is what does the patron mean by &quot;book&quot; and what does the librarian mean by &quot;work&quot;? Smiraglia's study of the nature of the work [smiraglia] shows that no one single definition of <em>work</em> exists among librarians. Of the many definitions that have been proposed by philosophers of bibliography, FRBR is only one. The FRBR definition is also one of the few that has been formalized as a model, although we will see that the formalization of FRBR in relation to its description is leaves many open questions.</p>
    <p>If we look at the user view with basic level of categorization in mind, as well as the user's goals, we can then compare that with the definitions in FRBR. I'll take as a very simple case a person going to the library to find and check out a book. This person goes to the library and says that he is looking for &quot;the book, Moby Dick.&quot; Lubetzky and others would say that the user is interested in the work, not a specific physical item. Taniguchi would instead say that the user is interested in the text, not the abstract work. Cognitive science would say that &quot;the book, Moby Dick&quot; is understood to be shorthand for an actual, physical book with the text of Moby Dick, and that the user hopes to leave the library with a concrete item in hand. The abstract levels of W E M in FRBR are not only not of interest to the user, they may not exist in the user's level of categorization. This means that the user may not include in his conceptual level that there are variations like translations, annotated editions or works about Moby Dick -- at least not unless confronted by these in the catalog or on the shelf.</p>
    <p>The expert user view, for example that of a professor of American literature who is doing a particular study of technical language in Melville's text, could be very different. Although the level of categorization will be different to that of the casual reader, the focus is still likely to be on the text in a concrete form (on the page or in a digital format). This user may qualify his request as being for &quot;an authoritative version of Moby Dick&quot; and may want to check the <em>bona fides</em> of the publisher or digitizer. This person is interested at the level of the manifestation, but is still hoping to exit with a real world object that he can study.</p>
    <p>If I say that I have read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; I am speaking of an experience with a physical book or device that contained the words of Melville and the story those words express. As semioticians might claim, the ideas left in my head from that experience were developed through my experience with the physical book, the text on those pages, what was going on around me during the time that I was reading, and how I  interpreted the meaning of that text in my personal context. Nevertheless, a real world object was encountered.</p>
    <p>In both speaking and thinking we use single and simple terms to represent complex topics, otherwise we could not communicate efficiently. The shorthand used can be fairly imprecise and still support communication. &quot;Have you read Harry Potter?&quot; can mean any or all of the books in that &quot;arc&quot; or series. I could answer simply &quot;Yes,&quot; meaning that I have read at least one of the works or perhaps all of them. In daily conversation, these shorthands do not cause us problems, in part because we can clarify in the conversation, &quot;All of them?&quot; &quot;Which ones?&quot; But we can also go straight to &quot;What did you think? Good?&quot; </p>
    <p>In the cognitive sense, these are not abstractions, but are shared concepts for concrete things that we express with a commonly understood level of categorization that is not too broad to communicate to the other person, but not more specific than it needs to be. </p>
    <p>In the Pisanski/Zumer studies we see that users are able to organize a version of the bibliographic universe when given cues at various levels of specificity. This does not tell us, however, whether their views meet that of FRBR in the sense of abstract versus concrete, or if the task that the users performed was one of general/specific or &quot;most inclusive/least inclusive.&quot; Descriptions of FRBR invariably define the Work as an abstraction, yet when I ask &quot;Have you read Harry Potter?&quot; my question implies inclusion: that the shorthand &quot;Harry Potter&quot; represents the whole, and that I am asking my listener about one or more physical books that the person may have held and read. In terms of FRBR, each of the group 1 named categories  implies the whole. They are not entities because they do not exist as separate things that can be experienced.    </p>
