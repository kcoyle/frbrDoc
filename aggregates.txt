FRBR depicts Group 1 as a single, directional network in which each entity is in a specific relationship with one other of the Group 1 entities. They therefore form a line from Work to Item, and Item back to Work. Difficulties arise, however, in the relationship between Expression and Manifestation. What intercedes here is the complication that publishers and producers of available issuances of creative works add to the picture. While it may be quite accurate to say that an expression is manifested in a physical product, it is something else to say that the physical product is <em>the</em> manifestation of the expression. The reason is that the physical, publisher-produced package nearly always has content and qualities that are <em>in addition to</em> the expression. The content is described in Genette [genette] as "paratext." Paratexts are sometimes described in library cataloging, depending on their perceived importance (e.g. a preface by a known scholar), but not always. In addition, the publisher is noted only as an element of the title page (which is, by the way, one of the more important paratexts supplied by the publisher), and no attempt is made to provide an identity for the publisher.

Not only do publishers include paratexts in publications, they also create aggregations of Expressions of Works, and not always with the participation of the original creator. Aggregates can contain works of a single author, or those of multiple authors. Because of the inclusion of paratexts, the difference between multiple expressions in a single manifestation and the presence of an expression and paratexts is not always clear. In addition, collections have a wide degree of "workness." The collected works of a creator obviously have a strong element of "oeurve-ness." On the other hand, a recording of two or three musical pieces by a single composer may be little more than the publisher's determination of an optimum number of minutes given the physical medium of publication. A publication of conference papers may cover a wide range of topics, depending on the breadth of the conference, making "workness" nearly impossible to define.

The question that one asks at this point is whether the FRBR Manifestation refers to the Expression that has been published, or whether it refers to the entire publication. The FRBR document allows for either the treatment of an aggregate as a work in itself, or as a whole/part relationship, such as with book chapters or articles in a journal. The whole/part relationship [frbr, section 5.3.1] has two types: the dependent part, one that does not stand alone or is integral with the whole (such as illustrations in a text] or independent part, such as an article in a journal. While "[t]here often will be no reason for a dependent part of a work to be separately identified or described...", "[i]ndependent parts of a work are more apt to be identified and described in their own right." [frbr p. 68]

If manifestation does not refer to the entire publication, then it isn't clear how the fullness of the publication is covered. It also isn't clear what the difference is between "is manifested" and "is part."

The FRBR study group struggled with the question of aggregates, albeit primarily from a cataloging rules point of view. The decided to consider two competing views of aggregates:
<ol>
	<li>Aggregates as manifestations [oneill2009]</li>
	<li>Aggregates as works [tillettnd]</li>
</ol>
Ed O'Neill and Maya Zumer presented the argument for aggregates as manifestations. This makes use of the many-to-many relationship between expressions and manifestations. Because any manifestation can manifest multiple expressions, an aggregate is a "combination of expressions" in a single manifestation. They also note that there are types of aggregates: collections (which are aggregates of independent work), augmentations (which contain supplemental material around a primary work or works), and parallel aggregates, which are often texts that appear in more than one language in the same publication.

Tillett's paper takes the view that an aggregate is a work in itself, and that it has a whole/part relationship with any works that are included in the work. Therefore, a "work can be a work of works," which could be shown with a recursion symbol on the box for the work entity. In her text she states that "The recursive symbol was omitted from the final text, but since this is causing confusion, I feel it should be re-introduced..." [tillettnd, p.2]

The final report [oneill2011]Â  concludes with an aggregation of its own, a combination of features from the two viewpoints described above.

As stated in the final report of the working group [oneill2011]:
<blockquote>"Collections have not been uniformly treated and no consensus has yet emerged regarding how they should be treated. Collections have been considered (1) to be a single work with the individual becoming parts of the collected work, (2) a manifestation of separate works, and (3) a collective work comprised of the individual works." [oneill p2]</blockquote>
The first possibility speaks of parts, while the other two state the issues in terms of entity/entity relationships, like a manifestation of separate works. One of the areas that is left unclear (at least to me) in FRBR is the relative definitions of the manifestation of multiple expressions as opposed to the possible whole/part relationship that can exist between entities of the same type.

The group concluded that the FRBR approach to aggregates would use the many-to-many relationship between expressions and manifestations. However, since aggregates have some properties of their own (such as a creator of the aggregate), aggregates may also be seen as works on their own. Any one instance can have multiple works as well as a single aggregating work.

The aggregating works do not have parts, so the recursive element suggested by Tillett was not included in the final report.The final report also did not resolve the difference between a manifestation that manifests multiple expressions and a manifestation with parts. This seems to be a significant weakness in FRBR that one would want to resolve. Le Boeuf states ["all publications are aggregates"] and taking this view would lead to a more consistent treatment of publications than the current FRBR thinking. A publication always goes beyond the mere manifestation of an expression. Even the choice of page design, the use of covers, employing a font and pagination, perhaps adding a table of contents and index, all of these make the manifestation more than a manifestation of an expression. Yet the FRBR design implies that manifestation represents the whole, since the other aspects of manifestation are not present. In that case, a manifestation cannot wholly manifest more than one expression. Instead, it would appear to be more accurate to say that each expression (whether there are one or more) is manifested in part of the publication.

The study of aggregates is evidence of a significant difference between the cataloging view of library metadata and the view that a data designer would take. It is quite awkward, and not recommended, for data designs to have exceptions, or "either/or" situations. The study of aggregates as manifestations cites some statistics from OCLC about the percentage of items that are aggregates. In data modeling, it does not matter if 2% or 98% of your instances will exhibit the characteristic in question; the model must solve the problem in a way that is valid for all of your data. For example, in a situation where you can have many-to-many relationships in your data, the data must be modeled that way even though a majority of your instances might be one-to-one. The Study Group did arrive at a solution that works for all situations, although they still did not clarify the use of the whole/part relationships that are included in FRBR.
I think one difference is that with part/whole relationships, you definitely need works on both levels: The aggregate as a whole must also be a work, else there can be no related works (the works contained). If, however, the aggregate itself cannot be seen as a work in its own right (e.g. as in your example of the three pieces of the same composer), then there can't be part/whole relationships either.
