	<h2>How the FRBR Study Group Came to Be</h2>
	<p>The study arose out of an IFLA-sponsored Stockholm Seminor on Cataloguing in 1990. The IFLA cataloging section had been working on international cataloging standards for decades, most prominently the creation of the International Standards for Bibliographic Description (ISBD). Barbara Tillett's 1994 report on the meeting and its outcomes describes the factors that led to the assignment of the FRBR study group; she refers to &quot;the mounting costs of cataloging,&quot; the proliferation of new media, &quot;exploding bibliographic universe,&quot; the need to economize in cataloging, and, most importantly for our current investigation, &quot;the continuing pressures to adapt cataloguing practices and codes to the machine environment.&quot; [tillett1994]</p>
    <p>Given the concerns about the costs of cataloging, Tillett states: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Some speakers proposed that cataloguing could be considerably simplified. One speaker stated that the number of descriptive data elements needed in a bibliographic record could be reduced without seriously affecting access.&quot; [tillett1994]</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>What I find most interesting in Tillett's document is the statement that the members of the Seminar could arrive at no consensus on the &quot;functions of bibliographic records,&quot; no &quot;common agreement on what the bibliographic record is to achive in answering user needs.&quot; This is a strong statement about the perceived state of cataloging in 1990, 150 years after Panizzi drew up his 91 rules, and after the creation of the detailed cataloging rules in the Anglo-American community, as well as the ISBD rules designed by IFLA for international bibliographic exchange. It becomes clear from this why the group saw the need for a study. As we follow through with our analysis of FRBR, however, we find that the clarification of the functions of bibliographic records is overshadowed by the task of creating a formal entity-relation structure, with too little explanation of how that structure answers the questions that arose at the Seminar.</p>>
