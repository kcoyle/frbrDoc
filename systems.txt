		<h2>FRBR and Systems</h2>
		<p>The treatment of the FRBR entity/relation model as a database design by the JSC for RDA appears to have some mild assumptions about systems efficiency, as well as improvement of services to users:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The data structures used to store the data and to reflect relationships, however, will have a bearing both on the efficiency of data creation and maintenance, and on the ease and effectiveness with which users are able to access the data and navigate the database.&quot; [jsc5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two ways in which efficiency of a database is commonly  measured, and these ways may be partly in conflict. First, the storage requirements for Work data  (and to a lesser extent Expression, because it contains few fields) would be reduced because there would be less duplication of these elements in the database. None of the statistics that we have on hand, however, measure data storage, so it remains an open question whether the savings is significant in some way.</p>
<p>Second, effieiency of a database often depends on how many joins and reads are required Much depends on underlying design and the particular capabilities of the database management system, so there is little that one can say about efficiency in general, although one could  test different solutions. The key question here is whether the majority situation of 1:1:1 entities creates a disadvantageous number of operations that is not offset by the gains of the many:many:1 of the minority.</p>
<p>The RDA Scenario 1 [rdascenario1] shows what the JSC calls a &quot;relational/object-oriented&quot; data model. It appears to be a fairly standard set of relational database tables. The JSC document that describes this clearly has a record-oriented view of the data, and the data is assumed to be complete. No work has been done to model outputs from such a database, yet it is plausible that there could be a great variety of outputs from the underlying data. For example, a brief user display could consist of:</p>
<p>creator (frbr:Work)<br />
  title proper(frbr:Manifestation)<br />
  availability (item)</p>
<p>And the query that produces this output might select only those items that are expressed as text (frbr:Work) in English (frbr:Expression).</p>
<p>The underlying data model is not the same as the functions that can make use of the data. Thus the questions of data structure (e.g. for every manifestation there is one or more expressions, and for every expression there is one and only one work) may apply to the database design but not to uses of the data in applications.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of maintenance, and this can vary greatly depending on the overall model for systems. Clearly it should be better to make changes to a single Work entity rather than proliferating that change to many copies of that information in multiple bibliographic records. This is true not only within a single system but also across the bibliographic universe. In today's model, changes made at the level of the shared bibliographic database (generally WorldCat, but there are others),  must proliferate out to the hundreds or thousands of local databases that contain records for the same item. As local systems are often under-powered for massive data update, this method is costly, and some local systems are not able to accommodate such changes.While updating a single Work or Expression record is more efficient than updating a number of &quot;unit records,&quot; the extent of gain depends greatly on the particular holdings of the library affected by the change. The alternative is a cloud-computing model where local systems hold only local information and thus bibliographic updates are &quot;inherited&quot; simply by use of the central file for access. This is the model used by WorldCat Local libraries, who theoretically no longer need to maintain a local copy that is up-to-date with bibliographic changes. </p>
<p>Thus, how efficient the Work/Expression is for maintenance depends on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the extent of many:many:1 in the local catalog (which is often a function of the library size)</li>
  <li>the extent to which bibliographic data is shared rather than copied to local systems</li>
</ul>
