				<h2>The Entity-Relation Model</h2>
<h3>or, What exactly is being modeled?</h3>
<blockquote>"FRBR is not a data model. FRBR is not a metadata scheme. FRBR is not a system design structure. It is a conceptual model of the bibliographic universe." [tillett2005 p. 197]</blockquote>
Nearly every book, article or presentation about FRBR has an explication of the primary FRBR entities and their relationships. The entity-relation (E-R) analysis defines the primary structure of the document, which has chapters for entities, relationships, and attributes. The document has three diagrams that give a macro-level conceptual model of the FRBR data universe. Although the text is extensive (142 pages) these diagrams that illustrate the entities and their relationships primarily what people know about FRBR.  The diagrams make use of a modeling technique introduced in 1976 by Chen.[chen] The use of this particular modeling technique was a requirement posed by the Terms of Reference for the study, a fact that is interesting in itself. Because of the great influence that this modeling technique had on the outcome of the study, it is worth looking at it in some detail.

The outcomes of the FRBR study are described as an entity-relation model (E-R model), and in particular a conceptual E-R model. Here it is important to note that the final "R" in FRBR is "Records", and that the group was tasked to defined the functional requirements for bibliographic <em>records</em>. Given that, it makes sense to ask how the group came to be using a methodology that was developed to be an early design step in a relational database design.

Use of entity-relation modeling was a requirement stated in the <em>Terms of Reference</em>, which was authored by Tom Delsey and Henriette Avram. The <em>Terms</em> even include a reference to <em>Data Analysis: The Key to Data Base Design</em> by Richard C. Perkinson, 1984. According to Olivia Madison, who was chair of the study group from 1991-1993 and again from 1995-1997:
<blockquote>"As mentioned earlier, Delsey had originally authored, with Avram, the initial CDNL [nb: Conference of Directors of National Libraries] <em>Terms of Reference</em>, and was well versed in the research literature and potential applications of E-R modeling. In fact, it was largely due to Delsey's commitment to this modeling technique that it was explicitly included in the CDNL <em>Terms of Reference."</em> [madison, p. 21]</blockquote>
Madison also adds that both Barbara Tillett and Elizabeth Dulabahn (both of Library of Congress) had used the scholarship of Perkinson and Chen and that Dulabahn had extensive experience in system design. [also p. 21] (check wording)

The FRBR document, as well as talks and papers by members of the Study Group, promotes the E-R model and repeatedly makes the point that the model is conceptual. The document does not define what it intends by "conceptual," but the standard E-R modeling definition would say that it is an analysis of the data environment and functionality as to entities, attributes of the entities, and relationships between the entities. E-R modeling methodology is used in the development of relational databases, and is followed by a logical database design and then a physical database design. The conceptual design in itself is not directly translatable to a technology solution without these additional steps.

Another statement that we have regarding FRBR is the assurance that the resulting analysis is not a record design. But there is an acknowledgment that the report answers some questions that could be applied to bibliographic records:
<blockquote>"The study makes no a priori assumptions about the bibliographic record itself, either in terms of content or structure. It takes a user-focused approach to analyzing data requirements insofar as it endeavours to define in a systematic way what it is that the user expects to find information about in a bibliographic record and how that information is used. The study uses an entity analysis technique that begins by isolating the entities that are the key objects of interest to users of bibliographic records." [p.3]

"The entity-relationship analysis reflected in the model might also serve as a useful conceptual framework for a re-examination of the structures used to store, display, and communicate bibliographic data." [p. 6]</blockquote>
In addition, the summary of outcomes from the Stockholm Seminar (1990) and the description of the beginnings of the FRBR Study Group work concludes:
<blockquote>"We hope this exercise will provide the basics for development of future structured bibliographic databases and future systems that facilitate creation, maintenance, and use of such databases;..." [tillett1994]</blockquote>
Earlier in that document, in describing the E-R method, Tillett states:
<blockquote>"This approach differs from some other approaches in that it begins with an abstract of conceptual schema of the domain or universe in question. The universe is characterized in terms of the entities in it and the relationships that hold among them. As such, the conceptual schema is not restricted by the capabilities of any particular database system and is independent of any particular record definition."</blockquote>
At the time, the E-R approach was new to some if not most members of the Study Group. The FRBR document itself refers to readings in this area:
<blockquote>"The entity-relationship analysis technique and the conventions for graphic presentation that are used in this study are based in large part on the methodology developed by James Martin and outlined in his book <em>Strategic Data-Planning Methodologies</em> (Prentice-Hall, 1982). Graeme Simsion's <em>Data Modeling Essentials</em> (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1994), Richard Perkinson's <em>Data Analysis: the Key to Data Base Design</em> (QED Information Sciences, 1984), and Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant Navanthe's <em>Fundamentals of Database Systems</em> (Benjamin/Cummings, 1989) were also used in shaping the methodology for the study. All four books are recommended to those who are interested in additional background and more detail on entity-relationship analysis." p.10</blockquote>
Note the emphasis on database design. Also note the dates on these books. E-R modeling was developed in the 1970's in support of what was then a new database technology, the relational database. The "conceptual model" of E-R modeling is not conceptual in the philosophical or cognitive science definition of "conceptual," but is a first step toward development of an actual data processing system. In philosophy or cognitive science, concepts can be imprecise, changeable over time and within different contexts, and probably could not be accurately developed into anything as mechanical as a database management system. In E-R modeling the concepts define the main categories of things that must be described in the data in order to support the functional requirements of the system. Therefore, the statement the FRBR is a conceptual design does not remove it from the realm of data and database design; it just makes it a first step in such a design.

FRBR, as I have already stated, is now nearly twenty years on from its initial conception. Relational database design, while still used in business applications, is no longer cutting edge technology. Although E-R modeling is still common, it has changed significantly from the first model proposed by Chen. In fact, as Ronald Murray shows in a slide from his presentation on data modeling [murray, slide 11], even before the FRBR Study Group began its work, E-R modeling had become more expressive:

The design on the left demonstrates the notation used in FRBR. However, Maxwell points out [maxwell] that the FRBR actually adds to this notation by including an additional set of boxes around each of the three groups. This would normally indicate that the outer boxes represent classes, and the inner boxes represent sub-classes.

<img alt="frbr figure 3.3" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/Page16frbr_2008.jpg" width="170" height="220" />

This  contradicts the insistence, on the part of the FRBR Review Group, that the groups do not have an identity in the model, and that there are no super/sub-class relationships.

In E-R modeling it is generally accepted that there are three levels of modeling: <strong>conceptual</strong> (which establishes the overall scope of the data universe being considered), <strong>logical</strong> (adding detail of entities and relationships), and <strong>physical</strong> (a model of an actual database design). FRBR is stated to be a conceptual model by the Study Group. The diagrams show a macro-level model that includes only what are considered to be the primary relationships between entities. Other relationships are defined in the text, such as work/work relationships. The macro-level model does not resolve the modeling of the many-to-many relationship between expression and manifestation, which is typical of conceptual models.The text includes "attributes" for each entity but states that these could be expanded, again typical of conceptual models.

Although the study group emphasized the conceptual nature of FRBR, they did not continue on to say what should be done with that conceptual model, since it is not actionable in that form. A logical completion of the model would be to use the defined attributes to develop a bibliographic record definition, since that appears to be what the study was intended to lead up to. Another possible next step would be to move from the conceptual model to a logical database design.
