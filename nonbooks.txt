<h2>FRBR and Non-books</h2>
		Although the FRBR study group stated that FRBR was designed to described a model that could be applied to any type of bibliographic data, numerous articles have covered a re-interpretation of the conceptual model for specific resources types.
        <h2>FRBR and Serials</h2>
		

<p>Serials cataloging deals with a particularly complex set of relationships: the whole/part relationships between the works that users generally seek, the articles, and the continuing resource that the is serial itself; and the question of when a serial becomes a new serial: at the change of a title? at the evolution of a topic to include new content?</p>

<p>Music is an interesting case even as presented in the FRBR document itself. While the Work of a textual item is, as Tillett describes it, &quot;the idea,&quot; the Work for a music item appears to be concrete enough that it can be performed by someone other than the creator. This could, however, be an artifact of the specific holdings of the library, which may not own a copy of the score that was the creator's expression of the musical work.</p>

<p>This illustrates what has been suggested by others, which is that the FRBR Work is an organizing concept rather than a fixed &quot;thing,&quot; and it organizes at a different level of abstraction within different contexts. </p>
<p>The Variations Digital Music Library 2 Project at Indiana University [Riley] analyzed the FRBR attributes for each WEMI entity and had a number of variations that it required to express the music materials. They found that there were additions needed to FRBR Work, including the addition of language and place of composition. They suggested that musical key was needed for both Works and Expressions. (In FRBR it is only an attribute of Work.) And music has the added complication of accompanying materials, such as liner notes, which also need a language designation in the Manifestation . </p>
<p>Schmidt [schmidt] brings up the intriguing question of improvizational jazz: could a jazz performance, which could be unique enough to be a new creation, be considered a new work? If so, that would mean that elements of performance (place, date) need to be included as attributes of the Work. The jazz example tends to modify the dividing point between one work and another, but it also could lead to different lines of demarkation between Work and Expression.</p>

<h2>FRBR and Movies</h2>
		<p>Yee [yee2007] finds that the FRBR definition of work accords with that of the moving image cataloging community, which is that the translation of a textual or musical work to film always creates a new work. However, this view is apparently not shared by the music cataloging community:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Film catalogers consider a film of a performed work to be a new work related to the previously existing text for the performed work. Thus a film cataloger considers Bergman's Magic Flute to be a new film work, not an edition of Mozart's opera. Music catalogers disagree; to them, Bergman's film is still primarily Mozart's work; that is, not a new work, but a new expression of Mozart's work.&quot; [yee2007, p. 124]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Yee describes FRBR, &quot;Change from any other GMD [General Material Designation or physical type]... into the moving image GMD... creates a new work by FRBR definition.&quot; [yee2007 p. 121] This contrasts with the music view where a new performance or recording is a new expression. </p>
<p>Turner [turner] addresses the many types of editing that can be performed on moving pictures, including removing content for reasons of audience (profanity, nudity) or to make the film fit the time allotted. These, according to Turner, are treated as new manifestations, where in the text world these would undoubted be considered new expressions. At the same time, there is interest in what Turner calls &quot;frame-level&quot; access to film (with examples like the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination and various foms of the 9/11 events). These are spontaneous creations, sometimes even accidental, and so the designation of a creative Work component may be difficult. However, should such un-planned footage be included in a documentary, its nature appears to change. Three people standing side-by-side at a scene may take nearly identical photos or films of an event. How many works are there? There are also the multitude of similar scenes shot for a commercial film which either are or are not included in the film, and yet may be reconstructed late into a new version of the firlm (&quot;director's cut&quot;).</p>				<h2>FRBR and Art Works</h2>
		p>Although library standards attempt to cover a wide range of library and museum materials, there is a significant distance between the description of published materials and the treatment of unique materials, such as works of art. The cultural object community has its own cataloging rules, <em>Cataloging Cultural Objects</em> (CCO)[cco], which differs considerably from the rules for printed and published materials. </p>
<p>In an analysis of FRBR in relation to art materials, Baca and Clarke point out that the separation of Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item is not applicable for many of the materials they catalog. The CCO rules define a work as a human-made object, meant to be perceived through the sense of sight. They go on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Because of this sense of physicality, <em>work, expression, manifestation and item</em> are one and the same for many cultural works, which are embodied in a <em>single material object</em> and not in an <em>abstract entity</em>.&quot; [baca, p. 104] (emphasis in the original)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entity diagram for CCO is:</p>
<p><img src="img/cco.png" width="566" height="382" alt="cco entity diagram" /></p>
<p>They concede that FRBR Group1 entities may be at times suitable to conceptualart and  art that takes place over time and in different forms, where the artist's concept and the execution of the art are not a single action. These do not always break down in to the WEMI categories of FRBR, however. It appears that the description of art works may need to make use of a variable interpretation of the Group1 entities, as necessitated by different types of art works. A simple example is in the role of color in artworks. In FRBR, color (&quot;colour&quot;) is an attribute of the manifestation, and is defined as &quot;used in the production of an image.&quot; [frbr p. 46] For some images, such as abstract paintings, color is the content of the work and defines the work. One need only look at the works of Andy Warhol where the same image of Marilyn Monroe is produced in different colors to know that color is inseparable from the work.</p>
<p>The CCO diagram has  equivalents to Group2, but it differs in how it treats what in FRBR are the Group3 entities. CCO adds two  entities: geographic place and concept, but does not list of Object or Event as primary entities. The Subject Authority in CCO is used to depict  the subject matter of the art work, what it is about. The Concept Authority is a thesaurus of terms used in description, perhaps similar to the various controlled descriptive terms developed for MARC records or for the RDA cataloging code. This thesaurus includes terms for objects, materials, activities, agents, physical attributes and time periods. In the final analysis, much of the same descriptive territory is covered although the organization of the elements is somewhat different.</p>
