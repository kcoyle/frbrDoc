				<h2>Issues: Meaning and WEMI</h2>
<p>Some interpretations of FRBR treat the work, expression and manifestation as a process, moving from the idea in the creator's mind, to an expression of that creation, and then to a manifestation where the expression becomes &quot;manifest&quot; or physical in nature. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Content relationships can be viewed as a continuum from works/expressions/maniffestations/items. Moving left to right along this continuum we start with some original work and related works and expressions and manifestations that can be considered 'equivalent,' that is, they share the same intellectual or artistic content as realized through the same mode of expression.&quot; [tillett p. 4]</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>While it may be possible to see a direct line, under the control of the creator, between work and expression, for published works the next step in the process, the manifestation, is less direct. For those resources where publishers and producers are involved in the production of the manifestation, the result can have many features not produced by the creator of the expression. Not only do book publishers add design and marketing features, but they are often also responsible for the addition of a preface and indices. Particularly in fiction publishing, the publishing house may have a strong role in shaping the expression. In music publishing, publishers often create new aggregates of works for marketing purposes, even combining works of different creators in a single package. </p>
    <p>This brings us back to the original question posed by Lubetzky, which is the difference between the work and the book, or the work and the package. As we will see when we discuss the work of the FRBR aggregates group, the FRBR group 1 &quot;cascade of entities&quot; runs into problems when faced with the reality of publishing and packaging. While the line from work to expression to manifestation may follow some ideal logic, it may have been more functional to separate the description of the package from its intellectual contents. Instead, manifestation, as described in FRBR, is still based on the traditional catalog entry that mixes content and carrier. This is addressed below in the section on Taniguchi's expression-centric model.</p>
    <p>FRBR Group 1 is a cascade of views of a single thing, although it has unfortunately expressed this as four separate entities using what I consider to be the wrong modeling technique. Group 1, rather than E-R style entities, could be described as a process with outcomes. The Expression entity does not realize the Work, it <em>is</em> the realization of the work. The Expression entity is an outcome, not an actor. As an outcome it is an expression of the work in some creative form, and cannot be apart from the work. The relationships between expressions are actually relationships between <em>expressed works</em>. The same is true of the manifestations, which are the results of some action that produces a physical manifestation of the expression of the work and that clearly cannot be separated from the expression of the work.</p>
    <p>The unfortunate use of a diagramming technique designed for separate  entities has led the FRBR Review Group to treat a gradation of abstractness as four separate <em>things</em> that cannot be separated. The E-R diagram deals with this by defining mandatory relationships between the entities, but this only really serves to keep the entities separate from each other, not as the whole that it is. There is a tendency to describe the Work as being &quot;first&quot; in the FRBR bibliographic stack, but the Work could not exist unless it is Expressed,  Manifested, and available as an item someone in real space. The Group 1 entities come into existence simultaneously in a  real world form as the result of the act of creation. This form could be a manuscript or performance, but what most of us encounter in libraries is generally a  publication or other public exhibit of the work. (Although the Pisanski/Zumer studies [pisanski] showed that this &quot;first public manifestation&quot; was an important concept for the users in their studies, it is not acknowledged in FRBR or the cataloging rules.)</p>
<p> Most explanations of WEMI move from Work to Expression, then to Manifestation, in that order, and most give only a slight nod to Item. But in terms of cataloger workflow, WEM is a single unit that is encountered with the Item in hand. Whether or not the same Work or Expression has already been described in a cataloging database is a system function, not a change in the nature of the item in hand, although it may allow the cataloger to reuse some existing data. While you may be able to store information about a Work or Expression separately in a database, you cannot separate the Work from the Expression or the Manifestation in real life. Whether or not one can separate ideas from their expression, and whether expression can exist without manifestation, is a question for philosophers and scientists, but none of us will ever experience a Work except in the context of a full WEMI. </p>
<p>[carlyle &amp; others - WEMI could be viewed as sets]</p>
    <p>I would model the document's conceptual description of WEM as:</p>
    <p><img src="img/umlWEMI.jpg" width="570" height="390"  border="2" alt="WEM diagram" /></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="caption">Work, Expression, Manifestation, in Item</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>And, of course, item is a single instance, a whole, that is a Group 1 in its entirety and in a real form.</p>
    <p>This model describes the data used in the only test of user views of the FRBR conceptual model, that done by Pisanki/Zumer. In that test, users were given a set of cards that described various versions of a work and asked to organize them. The cards contained data that represented one of the Group 1 entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Works were represented by cards containing only the author and the title</li>
      <li>Expressions were represented by cards containing the author, the title, and the language or a statement of translation </li>
      <li>Manifestations were represented by cards containing the author, title, language or translation information, and publication information.</li>
      <li>Items were represented by cards describing a unique element of a copy, such as a signature, or a copy in a particular location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These four card types in their study reflect the conceptual model of FRBR but not the E-R model in that document. It is clear that <em>conceptually</em> an Expression cannot be solely a statement of the language of the text (or other stated attributes of the FRBR Expression entity), it must also include the associated Work information. The results obtain by Pisanski/Zumer of course were influence by the presentation of the WEMI data already separated into the conceptual four levels, but they could not have obtained any results at all using the components of the E-R model. In fact, the E-R model can only be approached as a fully formed data design including entities and relationships. Since this is a data structure in which individual entities do not form complete concepts, if broken apart (as in the card sorting study by Pisanski/Zumer) there would be no way to get them back together again in anything resembling an intelligent order.    </p>
    <p>That one might wish to store this in a database design as the WEMI expressed in the E-R diagrams in FRBR is always a possibility, although not a given. Before designing this as data one needs to do an analysis of processes and outputs that would transform the conceptual model into a data model. The linear design that is represented in the document is only one possible solultion. For example, without creating redundancy in the data, the links to creators and subjects can be proliferated to Expressions and Manifestations if the systems developers prefer having a direct link, either for reasons of efficiency or because they find it is preferable for their code design. </p>
<p>What one can conclude from this analysis is that the text of FRBR and the E-R diagrams in the document do not say the same thing. This is especially unfortunate because people tend more often to remember the pictures than the details of the text. In fact, the E-R diagram has become FRBR, and very little attention is paid to the text or even the examples. In particular, people forget that FRBR also includes a number of relationships between entities; relationships, that I would warrant should be reviewed with a new interpretation of Group 1 as a process.    </p>

The line between work and expression is not always that direct, because there may be different creators of expressions (translations being the obvious one) to the creator of the work. The work creator has no control over the expression creator in that instance.

(There's also the question of whether the creator felt that they had adequately expressed the work they had in their head/envisaged, but I can't see any way of covering that concisely and realistically in the context of FRBR, so am mentioning it only as a passing note.)




You may recall that the Pisanski/Zumer studies concluded that users give special attention to the original work, which is not noted in library cataloging. If it were, then we could distinguish better between what the creator created directly and other expressions. This is particularly interesting in music where presumably the creator creates a score, and both adapted scores and performances are considered expressions.

It seems clear to me that the expression needs a lot more thought. In some cases (e.g. art) WEMI are a single thing, indivisible. In others, I think that it may be necessary to have more than a single thing called 'expression.' However, as I've said in other places, overall I think that no one set of entities is going to work for all cases, so we need a more flexible design.
