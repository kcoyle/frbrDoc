<h2>Alternate Interpretations of the Conceptual Model</h2>
<blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The upshot is, as Allinson and Petrucciani point out, FRBR demans a work have an expression, an expression have a manifestation, and a manifestation have an item. But as all of these authors have pointed out, the bibliographic universe is more complex than that.&quot; [smiraglia2012, p. 364]</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the FRBR document does not give examples of possible variations. Had it done so, it would have had to present variant views of its analysis and the results would not have been neat. But it is well worth while to look at some variations, and how they fit, or do not fit, into the strict definition of the FRBR model.</p>
<p>Within the library community there are different interpretations of WEMI, primarily in the nonbook cataloging communities: serials, music and movie catalogers, in particular. While members of these nonbook communities have different interpretations of WEMI, it is evidence of the strength of the conceptual model that it can accommodate such diverse needs. </p>
<p>Also within the library community there is a wide variety of different interpretations of the meaning of &quot;work,&quot; many of which are not the same as the definition used in FRBR. Some of these are more philosophical and less focused on cataloging than FRBR, others can be considered foundations for FRBR development. (See Smiraglia [smiraglia] chapter 2 for a detailed history of the evolution of the work in Anglo-American cataloging.)</p>
<p>Clearly non-librarians also use the term &quot;work&quot; and the meaning of the term is not precise. There are databases of books and nonbook materials that were developed outside of the library catalog community that exercise a concept of work, and there are others that reference FRBR although they tend to interpret the FRBR properties to meet their own needs.</p>				<h2>Bibliographic Models Pre-dating FRBR</h2>
	FRBR implemented concepts that had been discussed in the library cataloging circles for many years. As we saw above in the section on the concept of Work and the importance that it had in 20th century cataloging theory, there was a general acceptance that the bibliographic record existed on multiple levels, although precisely what those levels were and how many of them existed was still open to debate.
<h3>Carlyle: Overview of models</h3>
<p>Alison Carlyle [carlyle] speaks of one-, two- and three-layer models of bibliographic data that preceded FRBR. In Carlyle's explanation, the original bibliographic model was a simple inventory of individual items in the library (one-entity); growing library collections found a need to bring together multiple editions of the same work (two-entity); then, attributed to Pettee [] in 1936, the concept of &quot;literary unit&quot; was added to librarians' consciousness, and this engendered the three-entity model. FRBR, of course, includes four bibliographic layers, of which Expression is considered to be the newest. It may be new as a layer, but information that describes the Expression has long been available in cataloging since this includes properties like language of the text and the edition statement. In fact, FRBR adds no new bibliographic description properties to those already described in the current cataloging rules, AACR2 [AACR2]. Its contribution is in dividing those into four layers, each with a fixed set of properties. As we'll see, however, there exist different interpretations of the meaning of the layers in different cataloging communities.</p>
<h3>Serrai's Five &quot;Realities&quot;</h3>
<p>Alfredo Serrai, author of numerous books of librarianship as well as the formidable eleven-volume <em>Storia di bibliografia</em> (&quot;History of bibliography&quot;), presents a model of the bibliographic universe with five &quot;<em>realtà</em>&quot;. These are not defined as entities, <em>per se,</em> but as aspects present in each book. [serrai1995, pp 64-65] These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creator: one or more beings in the various creation roles, such as author, compiler, translator, curator</li>
  <li>work:  the original composition by one or more authors. The communicable aspect of the work is expressed through its text</li>
  <li>text: the linguistic formulation of the work in the broadest sense of expression</li>
  <li>edition: the set of physical exemplars of a text</li>
  <li>intellectual content: the intellectual, artistic or recreational message</li>
</ul>
<p>(Translation/interpretation mine)</p>
<p>Each one of these has the potential to be expressed in its own complex system within library catalogs.</p>
<p>This has much in common with FRBR, but the differences are significant. First, Serrai views the book (or resource, as we would call it probably today) as something unified, even though it exhibits these simultaneous realities. Each of these aspects is something that needs to be brought out in a catalog. His analogy is that of the author catalog, title catalog and subject catalog. While the first two may exist together in dictionary form, the subject catalog could be a classed catalog, and thus would stand alone. Remember that he was writing in 1995 (and possibly earlier because the book I have in hand is a revision of a 1981 text) so that the use of a single computer system to provide these alternate views would not have been obvious.</p>
<p>Serrai distinguishes between the catalog that is primarily based on data transcribed from the publications themselves and a catalog that makes the publications accessible in a particular cultural tradition, such as by discipline. (This latter is often the primary organization of a library classification system.) The second type of catalog itself can take two different forms. One is the organization that we commonly think of as classification by subject or discipline. The other is a catalog that reveals the relations between works and their &quot;paternity,&quot; or their place in a bibliographic context. As we will see in the next section, paternity and bibliographic families play a large part in Wilson's concept of &quot;a work.&quot;</p>				<h2>Alternative Models Using FRBR Concepts</h2>
		<link>http://kcoyle.net/frbr/?page_id=81</link>
		<p>Each of the models presented below is a response to FRBR with some alterations. Given that FRBR presents itself as a conceptual model (at least in the text of the document), each of these uses that conceptual model and proposes a direction or implementation of it under different assumptions or using different technologies. </p>				<h2>Taniguchi&#039;s Expression-Dominant Model</h2>
		Shoichi Taniguchi appears to have spent two decades trying to create a model of bibliographic description that does not place the work nor the manifestation in the dominant position. He originally called his view "text-dominant" but that was before FRBR's expression was defined. His current work is a direct response to FRBR.

In Taniguchi's view, each bibliographic item must be described with a dominant expression entity. Titles, statements of responsibility (including added entries) and edition statements are described in the expression; the manifestation-level contains only those antributes related to publication, physical format, and publication date. His assumption is that the majority of user tasks should be satisfied by the expression in most cases, but could include the work in those situations where work information is normally provided. Using the single record approach, it is not necessary for a library to create separate entries in its catalog that describe individual manifestations if those are not required by the particular user community. Therefore, time is saved by entering into the catalog the information about the expressions held by the library, and allowing most users to make a select between manifestations (if more than one exists) at the shelf. The catalog record therefore informs users which expressions the library owns, which is the minimum information needed to fulfill the user tasks. Those few users interested in the details of the manifestation can go on to that level of detail in display.

He concludes, as I do in the above analysis of current cataloging practice, that very little information about works is included in bibliographic records, although data derived from the manifestation, such as creators, titles, and subjects, is about the work, not the manifestation. The emphasis in cataloging rules is on describing the physical item "in hand," and therefore the dominant entity is the manifestation. Taniguchi de-emphasizes the physical aspects and organizes his model around the content that the user encounters in the expression of the work.

In addition to providing his own expression-dominant view of works, Taniguchi analyzes existing views for the purposes of comparison. He gives an interesting categorization of what he sees as the two methods of defining bibliographic entities. The first is hierarchical: "a lower-level entity encapsulates its upper-level one. This method implies that each entity--except the top in a hierarchy--involves the properties of its upper-level entity and those of its own." He describes this as being an "is-a" relationship, and he interprets FRBR to be an example of this type of hierarchy. "The other method," he continues, "is to define a bibliographic entity in a mutually exclusive manner--entities do not share anything... It allows us to model an item with entities such as a work-level, a text-level, and a medium-level entity, each of which is defined as being mutually exclusive. A 'part-of' relationship therefore exists between an item and each of the defined entities, if the whole item is regarded as one entity." Taniguchi calls this latter method "the parallel way." [taniguchi2003 p. 7]

Note that Taniguchi interprets FRBR as being hierarchical, with the entities within the WEMI hierarchy to be in an 'is-a' relationship, and thus inheriting attributes from upper levels. This is a logical conclusion from the text of the FRBR document, which states that the work is "realized through" the expression, and the expression is "embodied in" the manifestation. A realized work would reasonably have the characteristics of the work, and an embodied expression is an expression. Renear et al have shown that the E-R diagrams in the FRBR document do not express this type of hierarchy. [renear] However, it would be very difficult to read the textual description of the entities as being separate in the way that the E-R diagrams suggest.

Taniguchi develops the parallel way as a separation of the bibliographic entity into mutually exclusive parts. This exclusivity is expressed in the entity-relation interpretation of FRBR, and is a quite plausible data design. However, nothing in the FRBR document addresses the difference between the hierarchy described in the text and the parallel or non-hierarchical view of the E-R diagrams. Only Taniguchi has made this difference explicit.

Taniguchi also sees the bibliographic entities as parts of a whole.
<h2>FRBRoo&#039;s Object-Oriented Model</h2>
		FRBRoo is a harmonization of FRBR and the Conceptual Reference Model of the International Council of Museums (CIDOC CRM). It is, as its name indicates, an object-oriented data model. FRBRoo is not intended as a replacement for FRBRer (the entity-relation model of FRBR developed by IFLA), but as an interpretation for an object-oriented environment, and a harmonization with museum practice.
<blockquote>"Expressing the FRBR model in a different formalism than the one in which it was originally developed provides a means to evaluate the model in terms of its internal consistency. It is also a good opportunity to correct some semantic inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the formulation of FRBR that may be regarded as negligible when FRBRER is only used in a library catalogue context, but that prove to be quite crucial from the moment one strives to design an overall model for the integration of cultural heritage related information." [frbroo p. 11]</blockquote>
Object-oriented models define both things and processes, while the E-R model used in FRBR is a static definition of entities and relations. However, some of the relations in FRBR ("manifests" "expresses") imply some action, and FRBRoo has taken an action or event-oriented view.  FRBRoo includes an event for each of the WEMI concepts, such as <em>Work Conception</em>, E<em>xpression Creation</em>, <em>Carrier Production Event</em>, and <em>Publication Event. </em>It recognizes the importance of these events and the role played by the various actors that are involved in the transformation from a creative concept to something shared with others.
<blockquote>"FRBRer envisions bibliographic entities as static, ever-existing things that come from nowhere, and overlooks the complicated path from the initial idea for a new work in a creator’s mind to the physical item in a user’s hands through the dramatically important decision-making on behalf of publishers. As a matter of fact, bibliographic records do contain implicit information about that complicated path and the relationships it implies between and among bibliographic objects; FRBROO digs that implicit information out of bibliographic structures, e.g. the precise meaning of “date of publication”. [FRBRoo2013, p. 13]</blockquote>
FRBRoo also extends the FRBR entities using super- and sub-classes. For example, there is an abstract class super to Work and Expression called "conceptual object", and sub-classes under Work itself for types of works, such as "individual work," "complex work," and "publication work."

<img alt="WEMI as dynamic" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/frbroo1.jpg" width="158" height="158" /><img alt="FRBRoo Work" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/frbroo2.jpg" width="164" height="147" />

Significantly, FRBRoo recognizes publication as an action, and treats "Publication Work" as an entity sub-classed to "Container Work." This at least partially resolves the difficulty that the FRBR Review Group had with aggregates and smooths the transition from the Expression to a publicly available package that has physical and intellectual characteristics that are added by a publisher but that are not included in the Expression itself. In FRBRoo, every publication is a kind of aggregate because it always contains some aspect of creation added by the publisher. This makes a publication, by definition, a package of multiple creation activities. Works that are not published, such as works of art, can be manifested without the intervention of a publisher, and therefore do directly manifest what has been expressed.
<blockquote>"'Manifestation' can be two completely different things: Either it is an industrial product, i.e., a Type, like a particular car model, or it is a Physical Man-Made Thing that was produced as a unique carrier of an Expression. Industrially printed books belong to the first category, and are indirectly related to the main author's original creations." [doerr2006 p. 3]

"In the course of discussion however it was recognized, that virtually any book is composed of multiple, distinct works: the text, the illustrations, the editors work on lay-out, type phase etc. The latter was widely ignored in FRBR, and discussions tend to confuse the question of which contribution and work is most relevant with how to make the necessary distinctions in a model. This situation demanded for a general model explicating both the individual contribution and the unity of the integrated product." [doerr2006 p.3]</blockquote>
FRBRoo

FRBRoo appears to have a consistent grounding in object-oriented technology, and to be shepherded by a group that understands that technology. That said, FRBRoo is extremely complex, and understood by few. If it is to be adopted it will need a user-facing interface that is comprehended by a wide range of metadata producers.
				<h2>Manzanos&#039; Object-Oriented Model</h2>
The Manzanos object-oriented model [manzanos] proposes hierarchical relationships as defined in object-oriented design. His analysis creates super-objects that, in his view, eliminate some of the awkward redundancy that the E-R model of FRBR contained. In the place of the repetitive FRBR entities for attributes like title (title of work, title of expression, title of manifestation) or "other distinguishing characteristic (in work and expression), Manzanos creates a super-object that represents the entire Group 1 and can therefore avoid this repetition.

<img alt="manzanos model" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/manzanos2.png" width="664" height="300" />

The use of a higher-level entity also would make future additions to the FRBR model easier. In the above diagram, Manzanos anticipates a universal use of identifiers for entities, and places this in the super-class DocumentalEntity so that it can be used throughout Group1 as needed. (Note that some of these high-level properties, like name and identifer, could be provided at a level even above Group1, thus providing an overall class for all FRBR entities.)

Manzanos also is concerned that, due to the nature of the FRBR E-R and its primary suitability as a step toward a relational database design, the model does not recognize resource types. Therefore:
<blockquote>"The question "Which instruments are performed in the play?" could be addressed to a novel. The attribute of the Original Language of Work could lead us to ask "In which language is the work?" to a sonata." [p. 6]</blockquote>
The solution to this issue is to create more granular class/sub-class relationships around types.

<img alt="manzanos types" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/manzanos.png" width="578" height="401" />

Whether or not you agree with the outcomes of Manzanos' re-interpretation of FRBR, it is a good illustration of the difference between a model based on concepts of relational database design and one based on an object-oriented approach. Not only does the object-oriented approach have true inheritance, it can also be more sensitive to the semantics of the entities and attributes than are in the metadata model.				<h2>indecs Event-oriented Model</h2>
The &lt;indecs&gt; metadata model was developed in the late 1990's and the current revised version is from 2000.[indecs2000] &lt;indecs&gt; models intellectual resource metadata around an e-commerce viewpoint, but intends its design to interoperate with the full product flow from the original creator, through the publishing and manufacturing steps, to outlets like stores and libraries, and then to the end-user.

&lt;indecs&gt; takes an event-based view of the metadata model, and defines metadata as a "relationship that someone claims to exist between two entities." All relationships are events, either static or dynamic, and events have inputs, agents, and outputs. The agents are key in the &lt;indecs&gt; model because these inform the question of intellectual property rights, which are one of the main elements of commerce.

The treatment of each entity as being the result of an event with the involvement of an agent resolves some of the questions about the nature of the FRBR Group 1 entities: where FRBR has works, expressions and manifestations as primary entities with flat relationships and no intervening human activity, &lt;indecs&gt; includes the persons or agents that act to create the entities. This answers the question: how does a work get expressed, and by whom? FRBR implies that the expression itself is the agent, but of course it can only be the output of some action by some kind of being.

<img alt="indecs diagram" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/indecs.png" width="504" height="413" />

&lt;indecs&gt; model of bibliographic metadata

&lt;indecs&gt; also recognizes that different media and different products can have different events. In particular, the performance event for music produces types of expressions that are not common for textual works. &lt;indecs&gt; places no limits on the types of relations that can be included in the model, although it lays out a general framework of metadata properties.
<h2>FaBiO FRBR-Aligned Bibliographic Ontology</h2>
		<p>FaBiO is one vocabulary in the Semantic Publishing and Referencing [spar] suite. This vocabulary development project has as its main focus scholarly publishing, with coverage primarily aimed at works that are published, textual, and/or referred to by bibliographic references. It defines its own set of entities that are sub-classed to the original FRBR entities (work, expression, etc.). FaBiO work and expression classes have numerous subject classes that define types of works and expressions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Work sub-classes</strong><br />
    announcement, artistic work, biography, case for support, correction, critical edition, dataset, essay, examination paper, grant application, image, instructional work, metadata, model, opinion, policy, proposition, questionnaire, reference work, reply, report, research paper, review, sound recording, specification, vocabulary, work collection, work package, working paper</p>
  <p><strong>Expression sub-classes</strong><br />
    Gantt chart, abstract, addendum, article, audio document, book, brief report, call for applications, case for support document, chapter, comment, computer program, conference paper, conference poster, cover, data file, data management plan, database, dust jacket, e-mail, editorial, excerpt, expression collection, figure, grant application document, index, instruction manual, lecture notes, letter, manuscript, metadata document, movie, news item, oration, patent application document, patent document, periodical issue, periodical volume, personal communication, policy document, presentation, project plan, quotation, rapid communication, report document, repository, spreadsheet, structured summary, supplement, supplementary information file, table, vocabulary document, vocabulary mapping document, web content, workshop paper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manifestation in FaBiO has only three sub-classes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Manifestation sub-classes</strong><br />
    
    analog manifestation, digital manifestation, manifestation collection </p>
</blockquote>
<p>FaBiO has dozens of properties for bibliographic description. There are common bibliographic properties like title, publisher, data of publication, pages, identifier, and language. It also has an extensive list of dates relating to the work flow of academic publishing, such as &quot;has submission date,&quot; &quot;has embargo date,&quot; &quot;has date received.&quot; FaBiO does not, however restrict use of bibliogrpahic properties to specific  sub-classes of FRBR's WEMI. </p>
<p>In addition to the extensions of FRBR provided by FRBRCore, FaBiO creates direct links between Works and manifestation, works and items and expressions and items. </p>

<p>FaBiO diagram [fabiodia]</p>
<p>The differences between the FaBiO entities and relations and those of IFLA's FRBR are not great. Where FaBiO diverges from a library cataloging interpretation of the entities, though, is in its emphasis on the expression. Like the Taniguchi proposal, FaBiO interprets the manifestation as a physical carrier, with all of the content description properties being located in the expression. The diagram below is a schematic interpretation of a FaBiO example. The work and its properties are in yellow; the expression and its properties in orange; and there are two manifestations, one print, one digital, in green:</p>
