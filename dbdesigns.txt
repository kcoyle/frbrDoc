<h3>RDA Database Designs</h3>
In 2009, the Joint Steering Committee for RDA (Resource Description and Access) issued a document outlining RDA database scenarios, the first of which provides a direct implementation of FRBR as a database structure, using FRBR entities and relationships. [jsc5] [attached here at end of doc.] Some of the same people who were involved with the development of the FRBR conceptual model were also serving on, or close to, the RDA group. In particular, the RDA Implementation Scenarios document was produced by Tom Delsey, editor of the RDA document, but also the co-author of the Terms of Reference that included the requirement to use an entity-relation modeling technique in the development of FRBR. Recall that the Terms of Reference document was first produced in 1992, so this potential implementation of FRBR as a database is 17 years later.

The RDA Scenarios document is an odd mix of record structures and database design. The third scenario is a flat file "database structure" with individual bibliographic records and authority records, but no linking between them. There is nothing to indicate that these are in a database rather than a simple set of files, other than the name of the scenario. In all three scenarios the boxed data appears to be a mock-up of a single instance, rather than an actual database design.

The second scenario shows the same bibliographic record and authority records, but now there are links between the headings in the authority record and the fields in the bibliographic record where that heading would appear. This scenario is structurally the same as the previous one, although there are arrows that point between authority records and the bibliographic record. The bibliographic record now hasthe name of the data element (<em>Authorized access point representing the expression</em>) followed by "[link]" and the two-headed arrow point between this and an authority record.

The third scenario is called "Relational/object-oriented database structure." This uses a similar notation but the boxes represent the group1 and group2 entities in FRBR.

This scenario does not represent the same entities and relationships as in the FRBR E-R diagram. First, it includes a direct link between Work and Manifestation, which is not in FRBR. Second, it does not attempt to model the many-to-many relationships between Manifestation and Expression. Third, it does it include the complex relationships that can exist between entities that are in a subject relationship to the work. In that sense, the scenarios cannot be considered actual database designs.

The document introduction states:
<blockquote>"In the second and third scenarios, RDA data is stored in database structures conventionally used in library applications. In those structures, data is stored in bibliographic records and in authority records... In both types of implementation, variant access points and other data used for access point control are stored in authority records." [delsey2009]</blockquote>
Unfortunately, what is said here is simply not true. The third design does not represent the actual database structures of library automation systems in existence today. I know of no functioning library systems that consist of flat files of bibliographic records. In fact, during the 1980's and 1990's, many library systems did make use of relational database management system (RDBMS) technology to manage keyword and phrase searching, and in some cases separate tables held searchable headings shared by bibliographic and authority data. Library systems have made some use of relational design (albeit not structured with the FRBR entities) since the earliest systems designed in the 1980's. [diagrams from 1985 at end; will have thumbnails here] Today, database management systems exist that are designed for text searching (e.g. Solr, Lucene) and the use of tables in the RDBMS sense are not necessary in those systems. The type of RDBMS design that is hinted at in this document has been superseded by table-less database management systems that are better at managing network models than the RDBMS was. As FRBR is a network, not a hierarchical model, the continued emphasis on relational databases is quite out of date. That both the FRBR Study Group and the RDA development group were unaware of this in 2009 is, if nothing else, a possible explanation for the outcomes of those efforts.

The general expectation that an implementation of the FRBR concepts as a reocrd would necessarily result in a four-part bibliographic structure perfectly paralleling WEMI was evident when the Library of Congress's New Bibliographic Framework [bibframe] draft model was announced. This model presents the bibliographic description as having two entities: Work and Instance. The BIBFRAME Work is approximately the same as a combined FRBR Work and Expression: it is intended to represent the abstract aspects of bibliographic description, which is consistent with the definitions of those FRBR entities. The BIBFRAME Instance has the characteristics of the FRBR Manifestation, which itself is very close to the ISBD bibliographic description. ISBD entities were used in the determination of FRBR attributes and informed work on RDA.[isbd] In BIBFRAME, FRBR Item information would be carried in a separate entity. There is nothing in BIBFRAME that contradicts the <em>conceptual</em> model of FRBR, but the effort has been repeatedly criticized as not following the "FRBR model," proof that FRBR is not viewed as a conceptual model but as a record format, as if the only way to satisfy the functional requirements is to have separate data structures for each Group 1 entity.

Overall, the results of the FRBR study fail to make a distinction between data designed for storage in relational database tables, conceptual design of a data universe, and the fulfillment of a task by users of bibliographic records. The resulting design is at a high level of abstraction that absolutely requires additional analysis once the final goal (database design, bibliographic record design) is determined. At this abstract level key aspects of a data design, such as efficiency for storage and retrievel, or flexibility for sharing, cannot be determined. If nothing else, FRBR can only be considered the first step in a multi-step process, but those additional steps require a clarification of goals. The step of conceptual modeling was never intended to be an end point, since the results of that modeling have no actual application.
