<h1>FRBR: a critical review</h1>
The purpose of this document is to gather together thoughts -- of mine and of others -- on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, and put them forth for discussion. I welcome all comments and discussion among those who post here.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Nearly twenty years after the first draft of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), and fifteen years after its final draft was released, the use of concepts and structures defined in FRBR is assumed to be the way forward for library data. Yet it isn't at all clear to me that we have an understanding of what FRBR means for library practice and for library users.

There is scepticism about FRBR in the library community which generally manifests itself in email discussions on library discussion lists. This scepticism however is expressed briefly (as is appropriate in an email discussion) and without great analysis. There is also praise for FRBR, mostly within the cataloging community. However, there have been few studies testing the library user's view FRBR [pisanskizumer] and not a great number of implementations. [lavoie] One promising implementation, RLG's RedLightGreen, closed its virtual doors in 2006 after the merger of OCLC and RLG. In the meanwhile, OCLC has experimented with FRBR in WorldCat and provides a partially FRBR-ized view of its bibliographic data, but has not yet achieved full "FRBR-ness." The only library systems vendor to profess to having a fully FRBR-ized bibliographic model is VTLS.

A report produced for the Library of Congress by Karen Calhoun in 2006 recommended investigating FRBR, showing that the author did not consider FRBR a "given" but one possible direction for bibliographic data:
<blockquote>"4.2.6 Support experimentation with FRBR and urge vendors and library service organizations to implement clustering based on FRBR concepts" [Calhoun, p. 18]</blockquote>
The Library of Congress report on the Future of Bibliographic Control [lcfobc] recommended that all work on RDA be halted while studies were done on the viability of FRBR. Although these two major LC reports called for systematic investigation of the ideas presented in FRBR, that has not happened, nor is it planned. In the meanwhile, FRBR concepts were incorporated into the upcoming cataloging rules, RDA, which had its opening implementation date of March 31, 2013 for participating US libraries..

In spite of lack of proof of FRBR as a bibliographic model, the concept of FRBR has reached beyond the library community. These implementations often differ considerably from the presumed library implementation. None of these efforts, perhaps with the exception of the development of the museum community's object-oriented model, FRBRoo [FRBRoo], provide an analysis of how they interpret FRBR that would help us understand why model may differ from the library community's interpretation of the same text .

While I don't claim to have the truth about FRBR, I can at least begin the discussion that I think we need to have: what is it? does it serve our needs? what can we learn from it?

     <p>In a study of this nature it can be hard to know how far back one should go to set the scene. The immediate historical events that led up to the development of FRBR are often given as a meeting at IFLA in 1990, but that meeting arose because of concerns that had been brought up over time as the modern patterns of resource production changed. </p>
     <p>One could begin with the first known works, writings of Greek philosophers, and early Jewish and Christian chroniclers of history and religion in the Middle East. The technical issues surrounding those writings include the dearth of and impermanance of writing materials, and the cost of hand-scribed book production, a condition that continued until printing became a technology of mass production some millennia later. Along the way we see the development of durable materials like parchment (albeit not in sufficient quantity), and finally the invention of a cheaper alternative, paper. With the Gutenberg revolution, book production moves from the scriptorium to the book production &quot;factory&quot;, and their collection is no longer limited to the imperial and monastery libraries. Books can be found in  the private libraries of the rich, in libraries serving newly formed universities, and eventually become so &quot;abundant&quot; that at least the Bible is found in many homes.</p>
     <p>The social and political story is equally complex. As a record of civilization that can communicate across generations, the written word often played a role in the struggles between peoples. Thus, libraries in both ancient and modern worlds have been targets to be destroyed along with the people who filled and nurtered them. Libraries and books have also been seen to be dangerous to the &quot;dominant paradigm&quot; and censorship has been instrumental in the history of books and libraries, presenting a difficult challenge for subsequent generations to recover what might be considered the &quot;authoritative text.&quot; </p>
     <p>The modern history of printing and libraries that has a more direct affect on the development of FRBR begins in the early 1800's. By that time, significantly large libraries existed in Europe, and the growth in printed books was such that a large library could hold multiple editions of a single work, where in the past a single edition was considered sufficient for a library of a respectible size. The growth of national libraries, [lerner, 109-123] whose mission was to preserve the printed output of the country, was instrumental in the inclusion of  multiple verisons of a single work in libraries.</p>
     <p> Although multiple versions of works might be viewed as duplicates, they could also represent significant variations, especially those works that had existed through turbulent times and had been recopied and republished through centuries of technological change. It became necessary, therefore, to distinguish between these &quot;near cousins&quot; for the purposes of study and also so that the library could know which items it actually held.</p>
     <p>This was the situation when Panizzi took over responsibility for the British Museum Library, with his commission as &quot;Keeper of the Printed Books.&quot; The first modern cataloging rules, known as Panizzi's 91 &quot;Rules for the Compilation of the Catalogue&quot; made a nod, albeit minor, to distinguishing editions by recording publishers, edition statements and dates, and by collocating translations immediately after the originals. The majority of the rules, however, were focused on determining authorship and the proper naming forms for authors.</p>
     <p>As the 19th and 20th centuries wore on, and the rate of publication and republication of materials increased, the question of &quot;the work&quot; became a serious one in library cataloging philosophy. Thinking in this area was greatly influenced by the work of Seymour Lubetzky, who was the most prolific proponent of a bibliographic catalog that emphasized a rational model that made evident the relationships between works. Lubetzky's main accomplishment was the re-thinking of the cataloging rules based on principles, rather than what Julie Pettee had called &quot;an encyclopedia of pedantic distinctions.&quot; [svenonius2001, xiv] Lubetzky is quoted as saying that when a user enters a library looking for a &quot;book&quot; he is in fact interested in the work, not the physical item. In his extensive study of the principles of cataloging he advocates for a principle of &quot;Identification of Work.&quot; </p>
     <p>Lubetzky's study of the ALA cataloging rules, commissioned by the Library of Congress, was a primary influence for the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules of 1967 (AACR), which incorporated &quot;workness&quot; in the form of the uniform title. Throughout the remainder of the 20th century, and the evolution of the AACR cataloging rules to a second edition in 1978, the concept of work continued to be discussed as an important principle in library cataloging. It also proved to be of an elusive nature, for no one single definition of work was agreed by all philosophers of library science. </p>
     <p>As we approached the development of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) in the last decade of the 20th century, however, the concept of organizing the library catalog around works had become an accepted principle. Meanwhile, in the period of Lubetzky's long lifetime (he was the honored guest at his own centennial, and lived to be 103 years old), the increase in book production that began in the time of Gutenberg had grown at an even greater pace due to the development of hot-type printing, which allowed typsetting to be faster and cheaper, and then to the &quot;no-type&quot; printing methods brought on by computer technology. New editions of works could be released at a previously unprecedented rate, and at the same time the number of new titles being printed is increasing. Add to that the fact that materials of all types are becoming available in an increasing number of formats, from e-books to disks to online music and films, and thus the role of the library catalog in helping users navigate the complexity of the versions of a work becomes, perhaps, its primary function. </p>
     <p>Where Panizzi used 80 of his 91 rules to address authorship and names of authors, and 11 to provide instructions on variations of works, FRBR's emphasis is on managing the work, its expressions, and manifestations. In discussions in the library community, when FRBR is mentioned, most likely the speaker is refering to the Group 1 entities for the most part (work, expression, manifestation and item), with groups 2 (person, corporate body) and 3 (subjects) having a mere satellite role, and, especially in the case of Group 3, being decidedly under-defined. </p>
     <p>The FRBR documentation does not specify among its goals the solution to the &quot;problem of the work.&quot; Yet the presentation of FRBR's work as the entity that all others exist in relation to (Smiraglia notes that it is only the Work that has a relationship to every other entity) reveals that the work problem is deeply embedded in the FRBR model. As we will see, however, the FRBR solution to this  is not without its own problems. </p>
