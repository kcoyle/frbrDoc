				<h2>Issues: Disjointness</h2>
		<p>The Group 1 entities as defined in FRBR do not share any  attributes. The attributes are each exclusively related to a single entity, and in the case of attributes that could be used for more than one FRBR entity the attribute has been defined to describe only one entity, as in Work Identifier, Expression Identifier, Manifestation Identifier, Item Identifier. Thus, each entity is a walled garden, distinction from the other Group 1 entities. This then leads to the question of disjointness of the entities.</p>
    <p>FRBR defines WEMI as entities in an E-R model. The model implies that each of the Group 1 entities is a separate thing. We've also seen that there is an expectation that each thing is modeled as a separate data structure. This then leads inexorably to some conclusions in terms of the data model. If each Group 1 entity is a separate thing, then each one is self-contained and has no overlap with the others. Entities that are mutually exclusive are defined as being &quot;disjoint.&quot; The formal expression of FRBR for the Semantic Web defines each of the FRBR entities (groups 1, 2 and 3) as mutually disjoint. </p>
    <p>There are some areas in data design where disjointness is both useful and necessary. You may wish to make these kinds of logical inferences with your data:</p>
    <pre>    all fathers are men 
    all mothers are women
    men / women are disjoint (no one can be both)
    Jeff is a father, therefore Jeff is a man</pre>
    <p>The letter to Jeff therefore begins: <em>Dear Sir</em>, and because Jeff is a man Jeff can never also be a woman or a mother.</p>
    <p>Most categories, however, are not disjoint. Jeff can be a teacher, a soccer coach, a deacon at his church and a World of Warfare player, all without any logical contradictions in the data. Mary can also be a teacher, a soccer coach, a deacon at her church and a World of Warfare player. The disjointness that has been defined between Jeff, a man, and Mary, a woman, has utility only in a very limited information space. They can both also be teachers, soccer coaches, etc. The reason for defining any entities as disjoint must be based on some necessary functionality, as in the example above where one wishes to address a person as either &quot;Dear Sir&quot; or &quot;Dear Madam.&quot; </p>
    <p>As we saw above, the FRBR E-R model creates separate entities for Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item, but this contradicts the FRBR document's definitions of those same concepts. In the text of the document, an Expression is a work as expressed, and therefore includes the content and meaning of the work. A manifestation is a real world realization of the expressed work, and therefore includes the content and meaning of the work as well as the expression of the work. This alone disproves the theory that the entities are entirely separate from each other. However, as we've seen, the E-R diagram and the text of the FRBR document are not closely aligned. The E-R diagram shows a bibliographic description that has been broken into four dependent parts that must be reassembled to create a whole. The document assigns a unique set of attributes to each entity, with no overlap. One could therefore conclude that the entities are disjoint, but before doing so, we must look at the consequences of that decision.</p>
    <p>One of the first arguments against disjointness as a functional choice is that, as the FRBR document itself allows, not all bibliographic communities are expected to have the same precise definitions of the FRBR entities:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Because the notion of a work is abstract, it is difficult to define precise boundaries for the entity. The concept of what constitutes a work and where the line of demarcation lies between one work and another may in fact be viewed differently from one culture to another. Consequently the bibliographic conventions established by various cultures or national groups may differ in terms of the criteria they use for determining the boundaries between one work and another.&quot; p. 16</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Clearly, if the boundaries can be different, then the assignment of attributes to entities must be able to differ. Yet nothing in the description of the attributes of each entity in FRBR takes this into account. Somehow, moving from page 16, which describes the Work,  to page 32, where the attributes are defined, all notion of possible variation is abandoned. As Maxwell says: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Given that FRBR emphasizes the fluidity of the concept behind the entity work, it is somewhat surprising that the document immediately gets down to the business of defining exactly where that line or boundary is (FRBE 3.2.1. pp 16-17)&quot; [maxwell, p.17] </p>
    </blockquote>
<p>The resulting description of the work and the list of attributes are thus presented as a single, unvarying view, and any deviation from it is a deviation from the FRBR model itself. The formal declaration of disjointness between entities enforces the view that there is only one &quot;right&quot; way to model the bibliographic universe.</p>
    <p>One must be cautious in defining entities as disjoint because disjointness results in considerable rigidity. That rigidity makes it difficult to change (&quot;women cannot be priests,&quot; &quot;two men cannot marry&quot;), and it also makes it difficult to interact with data from other communities that may not have the same restrictions. Disjointness means that all users of FRBR must have the exact same definitions of WEMI (which is most likely the purpose of the strict definition). If a specialist community determines that a physical attribute like color defines a new expression, they will be violating FRBR. This rigidity, as well as the fact that FRBR is considered &quot;true&quot; in its current form, means that any application must be either FRBR or not-FRBR, thus splitting the bibliographic world into non-compatible factions.</p>
