<h2>What is modeled in FRBR?</h2>
An E-R analysis is supposed to resolve category boundaries and assign attributes to categories of things or functions. [cite here] [more here] It also develops the relationships between entities.

FRBR defines three groups of entitites. The groups are not named, they are called only Group 1, 2 and 3. The groups themselves are included in some of the E-R diagrams but are ignored in further modeling. This means that there are no functions or qualities that belong to any of the groups.Each entity is separate with no definitional relationship to any other entity.There are no group/entity relationships that would a type of class/sub-class structure. One key consequence of this is that there is no entity that can be identified that represents a whole bibliographic description. This also means that one cannot address a resource that has, for example, an author, a language of text, and a date of publication. While there are horizontal relationships between the entities, there is no superclass relationship that would bring them together as a unit that has an identity.. [note to self: this matters in OO and SW]

Each group has a different conceptual structure. Group1, which could be thought of as representing a bibliographic description, consists of four mutually dependent entities that are modeled as a chain from Work &lt;-&gt; Expression &lt;&lt;-&gt;&gt; Manifestation &lt;-&gt; Item. Although the diagram does not include cardinality beyond one-to-one and many-to-many, it is clear to most readers that all four are needed for a complete bibliographic description, and that having, say, an Expression entity with no Work or Manifestation entity would not be meaningful. It isn't clear, however, whether the model intends to make all four mandatory as part of a description.

Group2 consists of Person and Corporate Body, and these have agent- or actor-type relationships with entities in Group1. Person and Corporate Body, unlike the Group1 entities, have no dependencies between them. They also do not share any functions or attributes. These two are more like the entities in most data processing modeling, although they could -- and perhaps should -- have been modeled as members of a class that share some attributes, like the relationships linking them to Group1 entities. Both of these entities could be an author, a publisher, a performer, etc., and therefore those attributes could be assigned to a class that includes all Group2 entities.

Group3 includes four entities that can have a "subject" relationship to the Work entity in Group1: Concept, Object, Event, Place. These, too, are independent of each other, and are not members of a class. The oddity here is that although these four entities are together in Group3, in fact all entities from groups 1 and 2 can also have a "subject" relationship with Work. This means that logically all FRBR entities could be sub-classed to a "subject" class. Group3 appears to round out the entities needed for subject assignment, but isn't itself a complete list of subject types even though it is referred to as the "subject" group.
				<h2>Group1: Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item</h2>
		This section looks at WEMI -- that is, Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item -- the entities of FRBR Group 1. This is the core of the FRBR E-R model, and these are the entities that draw the most attention.

				<h2>    How FRBR defines Manifestation</h2>
  <p>This  conceptual inclusiveness is also true of the Manifestation, which is &quot;... the physical embodiment of an expression of a work.&quot; [frbr 20]. A manifestation may be a singlet, as in an author's manuscript, or it can be a set of mass-produced things made publicly available, or anything in-between. They physicality of the manifestation is a primary characteristic: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;When the production process involves changes in physical form the resulting product is considered a new <em>manifestation</em>. Changes in physical form include changes affecting display characteristics (e.g., a change in typeface, size of font, page layout, etc.), changes in physical medium (e.g., a change from paper to microfilm as the medium of conveyance), and changes in the container (e.g., a change from cassette to cartridge as the container for a tape).&quot; [FRBR p. 22]</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>This brings us squarely into the &quot;multiple versions&quot; territory, one of the compelling cataloging issues of the 1990's: does a change of physicality require a new catalog record? The answer in the FRBR document is clearly &quot;yes.&quot; Therefore a hardback book and a trade paperback of the same book would be different manifestations, and each e-book format would also be a different manifestation. This would be in keeping with the distinctions managed by publishers of these materials, and in the assignment of a specific ISBN to each physical format.</p>
<p>Note that Manifestation  is not separate from the expression of the work as described here, it <em>embodies</em> it. That term alone argues strongly against any separation of attributes between the Manifestation and the Expression and the Work. Note that the FRBR document does not say that the Manifestation embodies the Expression, but that it embodies an <em>expression</em> of a <em>work</em>. </p>

				<h2>How FRBR Defines Expression</h2>
The FRBR Expression is "...the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of alpha-numeric, musical, or choreographic notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms." [frbr 19] The Expression is also an abstract entity in that there is no physcial realization of the expressed work until it is manifested as a Manifestation. It has a form of expression ("text" "music") and its attributes include a date, a language (for textual works), a medium of performance (for music or other performed works), and scale and project (for cartographic works). The expression excludes, however, "physical form... that [is] not integral to the intellectual or artistic realization of the <em>work</em> as such." [FRBR, p. 19] Therefore, the Expression is the artistic realization of work in every aspect except the physical form. It does include "the specific words, sentences, paragraphs... or the particular sounds, phrasing, etc. resulting from the realization of a musical work." The expression has all the qualities of a creation, but stops short of any physical attributes. So it is a text, but without a "typeface and page layout." It is music without any readable notes or carrier of sound.

Here we immediately face one of the key issues of the FRBR Group 1 entities, and that is the separation of what is essentially a single thing into four parts. The Expression is a realization of a work, and as a realization of a work it not only is not separate from it, it explicitly is one with it. The Expression IS the work, expressed.

The expression is at times presented as the source of the work as much as it is a production or realization of the work. For example, in the FRBR description of the work there is this explanation:
<blockquote>"A work is an abstract entity; there is no single material object one can point to as the work. We recognize the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the work itself exists only in the commonality of content between and among the various expressions of the work." [FRBR p.17]"</blockquote>
Using this description, the work may be seen as the sum of all expressions. Yet only a few pages later, the document says:

"An expression is the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is 'realized.'" [frbr 19]

In this case, the work seems to exist even before it is expressed, and the work appears to have a stable intellectual content that can be expressed in different ways.

What is clear is that an Expression entity on its own would have no content to express; instead, the expression has content, and that content is the Work. One possible conclusion of this for bibliographic description would therefore be that the Expression entity consists the Work entity attributes plus the attributes that are added by the Expression entity. The expression only becomes a separate "thing" in a data management sense if the data for the Expression is stored separately from the Work as a form of data normalization. Again we see that the FRBR document seems at times to present a conceptual design viewpoint and at others presents more of a data design.

Perhaps it would be useful to note, at some point, that these are not inventions of the FRBR report (or of cataloguing more widely), and have a much wider literature and discussion supporting them.

				<h2>How FRBR defines Work</h2>
		As we saw in a <a href="I.3.html">previous section</a>, numerous definitions of "bibliographic work" have been developed in the library field over time. FRBR defines Work as: "a distinct intellectual or artistic creation." In reference to FRBR work, Barbara Tillett defines it as "the conceptual content that
underlies all of the linguistic versions, the story
being told in the book, the ideas in a person's
head for the book." [btil] At the same time, FRBR considers changes in form (e.g. from a book to a movie version of the same story) to be different works. This shows how difficult it will be to form a widely accepted definition of work.

The FRBR document also states that "We recognize the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the work itself exists only in the commonality of content between and among the various expressions of the work." [p.17] This is considerably different from the definitions given in the previous paragraph. In this definition, the Work is a set of all of its expressions. This would make the work a dynamic entity that changes depending on the presence of particular expressions in the bibliographic universe. Thus the Work is presented both as a fixed a priori abstraction (in the mind of the creator) and as a dynamic entity that is the some of its expressions.

The Work is consistently referred to as an abstraction in library literature about FRBR, but the Work as defined in FRBR has the characteristics of something quite concrete: it has a creator, a genre, and subject designation, which is actually quite a bit of "realness" for something that is "the ideas in a persons head." It also has a Work title, which could be considered especially odd for something that has not be expressed or manifested yet. However, the Work title (along with the author) serves as the bibliographic identifier for the Work, so it has a necessary bibliographic purpose.
And maybe this is partly because the work can only be known through items containing manifestations of expressions of the work. That is, in cataloguing we start from the concrete and move to the abstract, because without the concrete there is no way of determining what the abstract actually IS.

				<h2>How FRBR defines Item</h2>
		<p>Item is the most neglected of the Group1 entities in most discussions, possibly because it is also the most clear. &quot;The entity defined as <em>item</em> is a concrete entity.&quot; [FRBR, p 24]. However, even here the meaning has some caveats. An item may consists of more than one physical object, such as a multi-volume monograph or a film or sound product issued on multiple disks. Each item exemplifies a single manifestation. In certain cases, such as with copies of special interest, there may be some variation between a single item and other items of the same manifestation, such as books that are signed by the author, or items that are damaged.</p>
    
				<h2>Issues: Inheritance and Hierarchy</h2>
		[It is a common assumption that the four entities in group1 represent a hierarchy with inheritance.
<blockquote>"The four levels are: Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item.
Each is an object derived of the preceding one and inherits properties from it." [Noerr]

"Expressions inherit properties from works and manifestations inherit properties from expressions, not vice versa." [aggregates p. 2]</blockquote>
In fact, it might be best if they did, but they don't, as Renear, et. al., so ably demonstrated. [renear] In fact, the E-R modeling technique used in FRBR cannot express inheritance. The four entities of group 1 are linked through relationships in a kind of bibliographic daisy chain, and therefore, for example, a FRBR Manifestation has access to the attributes of a FRBR Work through the link to the FRBR Expression. But as described, a Manifestation does not "have" an author or subjects because those are only attributes of a Work.

In addition, the inclusion of many-to-many relationships between Expression and Manifestation means that the structure of Group 1, in data modeling, is by definition a network structure. [simsion, p. 293] However, FRBR treats the structure as "a continuous chain" as described in section 5.2.1:
<blockquote>"It should be noted that although the relationships between work, expression, manifestation, and item are depicted in the entity-relationship diagram in a segmented way, they operate logically as a continuous chain. That is to say that the relationship from work to expression carries through to the relationship from expression to manifestation, and those two relationships subsequently carry through to the relationship from manifestation to item. Thus when a relationship is made between an expression and a manifestation that embodies the expression, the manifestation is at the same time logically linked to the work that is realized through the expression, given that the expression has been linked to the work it realizes." [FRBR, pp 58-59]</blockquote>
It's easy to understand why people assume that there is inheritance. Ignoring the many-to-many relationships (which are illustrated in the FRBR diagrams only through the use of multiple arrow-heads, and are easy to overlook in that form), you can produce a visual of an instance of FRBR that looks like this:

<img alt="tree diagram" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/tree.jpg" width="460" height="210" />
<p class="caption">Fig. A hierarchy</p>
This is structurally the same as, say, a taxonomy. In a taxonomy, the lower levels do inherit from the upper levels because each lower level is a "type of" the defined upper level. For example, a dog is a type of mammal, so dog inherents qualities from the super-class mammal.

However, an Expression is not a type of Work, and a Manifestation is not a type of Expression. The structure of FRBR does not represent a taxonomy and the entities are not in a class/sub-class relationship to each other. As we will see, the entities are treated as disjoint from each other in formal modeling, in which case they cannot also inherit attributes from one another.

The problem is that the shape the diagram is deceptive. The same diagram can, for example, represent an organization chart. An organization chart does not have inheritance -- lower level employees do not inherit the work responsibilities or salary of the levels above them. Each employee is a separate entity with a defined relationship to the employees "above" and "below." Like the FRBR entities, these relationships are are not of the "type of" or "is a" nature; an office worker is not a type of manager even though linked to the manager in the organization chart.

<img alt="organization chart" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/orgChart.jpg" width="460" height="220" />
<p class="caption">Fig. An organization chart</p>
The four levels of Group 1 are not hierarchical in the common sense of that word. They do have a defined order, and the order goes from concrete (Item) to increasingly abstract (Manifestation, Expression, Work). But the entities as diagramed are independent of each other, in the same way that a Person entity is independent of a Work entity.

However, as we've said above, Group 1 is not a tree structure. There are many-to-many relationships between the Group1 entities, which means that Group1 is a network of relationships. A more accurate diagram would look like:

<img alt="group1 diagram" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/tree2.jpg" width="470" height="270" />
<p class="caption">FRBR Group 1 with many-to-many illustrated</p>
This diagram includes is only the primary relationships of Group 1. You might say that they are the glue that holds Group 1 together; they are structural in nature. The bibliographic relationships ("adaptation of", "translation of", "supplements") are also important, and presumably are part of the fulfillment of user needs in the library catalog. Adding only a few of these relationships provides a much more complex and graph-like image. As we'll see when we describe Wilson's concept of bibliographic families, these relaitonships, where they exist, are extensive, sometimes involving many dozens of bibliographic items.

<img alt="Group1 with secondary relationships" src="http://kcoyle.net/imgfrbr/tree3.jpg" width="540" height="300" />
<p class="caption">FRBR Group1 with some bibliographic relationships illustrated</p>
In data design, a network structure is quite common, and the many-to-many relationship is hardly unusual. It does, however, mean that the implementation of the conceptual model as a logical model must do some extra work to make the many-to-many relationships function as desired. As a conceptual model, we must assume that FRBR is not directly implementable as designed.
