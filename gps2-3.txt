				<h2>Group2 - Persons, Corporate Bodies, Families</h2>
<p>This group originally had two entities, person and corporate body. The work on the Functional Requirements for Authority Records (FRAD)[FRAD] added a third entity, family, which is now assumed to be included in FRBR. The FRBR document does not add any new features to persons and corporate bodies compared to current authority records, although FRAD does expand the attribute list to include others, such as gender and places of birth, death and residence for persons, and language, history and field of activity for corporate bodies. </p>

<p>As with the other groups, there is no whole that would unify the group in the E-R diagrams, even though they are treated as a common unit in the text. Without a more general class or entity to which these could belong, some characteristics, like roles, will logically need to be defined separately for each entity, with a significant amount of redundancy. For example, both persons and corporates bodies can be publishers, collectors, dedicatees, defendants, etc. The lack of a super-class that unifies group 2 means that it will be necessary to decide which roles are appropriate for each group 2 member. As we will see, those implementing FRBR as a conceptual model usually develop a super-class for the entities in this group, which also allows one to work with data where the nature of the agent (especially person or corporate body) has not be previously distinguished.</p>

				<h2>Group 3 - Subjects</h2>
The nature of the third FRBR group is so odd that it simply has to be considered a miscellany: <em>concept</em>, <em>object</em>, <em>event</em>, <em>place</em>. It isn't clear what the study group members were intending with these entities. They don't match the elements of the Library of Congress Subject Headings, which has <em>topic</em>, <em>form</em>, <em>chronology</em>, and <em>place</em>.

While Group3 is known as the subject group, it is not the full range of subjects in FRBR. All of the FRBR entities can be in a subject relationship to the Work.
<blockquote>"The diagram also depicts the "subject" relationships between work and the entities in the first and second groups. The diagram indicates that a work may have as its subject one or more than one work, expression, manifestation, item, person, and/or corporate body." [FRBR p. 17]</blockquote>
Maxwell notes that the limitation of subject relationships to the Work entity ignores some cases in which Expressions or even Manifestations can have a need for topical access on their own. He suggests that "...it might be preferable in FRBR simply to define Group 3 entities as 'entities that serve as subjects of Group 1 entities.' [maxwell, p. 15] Actually, that definition would also have to be applied to groups 1 and 2, since all entities can be the object of a "has subject" relationship.

We don't learn any more about the Group 3 because the only attribute provided for each of the entities is a <em>term</em>. The document expressly limits the use of the group 3 entities to subject access, although in the introduction there is an acknowledgement that an entity like "place" might have use within the bibliographic description. It would also be logical for an object to have a place, and for that place to have a name and a geographical location with longitude and latitude. Because FRBR does not address extension of its entities or attributes it isn't clear whether the addition of extensions would interfere with having one's data considered adherent to the FRBR model.

While Group3 is known as the subject group, in fact the four entities there are additions to fill out the subject entities. There is even a question of whether the groups in FRBR are meaningful at all. Gordon Dunsire, who has created the FRBR representations in RDF for the IFLA FRBR study group, appears to have been instructed that the groups are not to be used as classes in the RDF sense.
<blockquote>"FRBR Group 3 is not represented in RDF as a class, following clarification from the FRBR Review Group: the Groups are used to simplify the entity-relationship diagrams, and are not intended to be super-classes. Instead, 10 separate properties are represented in RDF, all with domain Work and each with one of the Group 1, 2, or 3 entity classes as range, corresponding to Figure 3.3 in the FRBR report." [dunsire2012 p. 736]</blockquote>
We also learn little about the use of these entities because other than defining these entities and showing an E-R diagram with the subject relationship, subjects are not mentioned in the document. Quite astonishingly, they are not listed in the discussion of the user tasks. The "find" task lists:
<blockquote>"the attribute or relationship is typically used as a primary search term for locating the entity (e.g., the title of a manifestation, the relationship between a work and the person or corporate body principally responsible for the work)." [frbr 84]</blockquote>
In fact, subjects were not initially included in the <em>Terms of Reference</em>, but were added to the list of entities when the document was reviewed at the IFLA meeting in 1992. [madison, p. 22]

It's hard to know what to say at this point, because this is such an obvious gap that it makes it hard to take the study of user tasks at all seriously. It also points out the chasm between library cataloging and subject analysis, and between library cataloging and user service. How could a multi-year study, reviewed internationally, fail to conclude that use of the library collection requires access through subject headings and classification?
